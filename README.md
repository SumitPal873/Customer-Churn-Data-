 Customer Churn Prediction â€“ Data Analysis Project
 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior using a telecom dataset. The goal is to understand what factors contribute to customer attrition and extract actionable insights that can help improve customer retention strategies.

 Dataset
The dataset contains telecom customer details, including:

Demographic data (gender, senior citizen, partner, etc.)

Services subscribed (phone, internet, streaming, etc.)

Contract and billing details

Churn status (whether a customer left or stayed)

Key Steps in the Project
Data Loading & Exploration: Checked for nulls, data types, and basic structure using pandas.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed unwanted columns, and converted data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized churn by gender, contract type, tenure, internet service, etc.

Compared churned vs. retained customer distributions using countplots and histograms.

Insights:

Monthly contracts had a higher churn rate.

Customers with fiber optic internet and streaming services showed higher churn.

Longer tenure correlated with lower churn.

 Libraries Used
Pandas for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

 Objective
To identify key patterns that influence customer churn and help telecom companies:

Improve customer experience

Reduce churn rate

Build data-driven retention strategies
